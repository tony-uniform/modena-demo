# Modena Demo

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) demo enabled with Uniform Optimize and Presentation Management capabilities.

The project is enabled for edge-side personalization and A/B testing, however it is not required.


# Known issues
1. If you are using npm as your package manager, you have to upgrade to the latest release. 

# Initial application setup

## Step 1: Package installation

Install dependencies
```shell
npm install
# or
yarn
```

## Step 2: Application configuration

1. Create a new project on uniform.app and configure your desired integrations (see the list of supported integrations above). Your Uniform account manager can help enable relevant integrations.
1. Create API keys under your team on uniform.app:

   1. Create an API keys with the following permissions: 
        - `Read drafts` and `Read intent manifest`
        - `Compositions:Read Draft` and `Compositions:Read Published`
   
   1. Set the `UNIFORM_API_KEY` env var with this value.
   
   1. Create an API key for the CLI with wider permissions (must check all checkboxes under `Uniform Presentation Manager`)
   
   1. Set the `CANVAS_CLI_API_KEY` env var with this value.
1. Perform publish of optimize manifest by clicking the **Publish** button from your project's Personalization tab.
1. Copy `.env.example` as `.env`.
1. Setup your environment variables in `.env` file.
   ```bash
   # your project id inside uniform dashboard:
   UNIFORM_PROJECT_ID=
   ; # application api key (used for Optimize and Canvas)
   UNIFORM_API_KEY=
   ; # CLI key: needs all permissions enabled on Canvas feature level
   CANVAS_CLI_API_KEY=
   ```
1. Add connection tokens for your specific system you are connecting to:

   ```bash

       # BigCommerce
       BIGCOMMERCE_STORE_HASH=
       BIGCOMMERCE_TOKEN=

       # CONTENTFUL
       CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID=
       CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT=
       CONTENTFUL_CDA_ACCESS_TOKEN=
       CONTENTFUL_CPA_ACCESS_TOKEN=

   ```

1. `npm run push:<stack name>` to sync the component library and compositions from disk to your project.
    
    where *`<stack name>`*:
    - `contentful-bigcommerce`

1. Publish your compositions under /Presentation tab.

# Step 3: Importing content into CMS

## Import into Contentful

The Modena demo site comes with some sample content that must be imported into your CMS.
At this time, only the export dump for Contentful is available, content for other CMSs can be provided on demand.

1. Make sure you have an account with Contentful and an empty space (recommended). You can sign up for a free account at Contentful.com.
1. Login to Contentful via CLI: `contentful login` and follow the steps.  
Check that you have access to your space via CLI: `contentful space list`.

1. Run `npx contentful space import --space-id <your-space-id> --content-file content/contentful-modena-export.json` to import the content (change space id to your Contentful space id).


   Learn more about Contentful export/import in the official docs [here](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/tutorials/cli/import-and-export/).

1. Create Content delivery / API key tokens in Contentful under `https://app.contentful.com/spaces/your-space/api/keys`. You would need the following values for later:
   - Space ID
   - Content Delivery API - access token
   - Content Preview API - access token


### Run the development server

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run dev
   # or
   yarn dev
   ```

1. Open <http://localhost:4120> with your browser to see the result.


## Step 4: Run the application: 
1. `npm run dev` to start the project.
1. Open `http://localhost:4120/landing`

# Appendix A: Production application setup

## Step 1: Configure webhooks

If you are running a Jamstack-style deployment (kudos if you do :)) then you would need to kick off a site build when anything is changed within your project (whether it is a new intent added / changed, or a composition is created or updated).

Uniform allows you to configure webhooks allowing to trigger site builds (in Netlify, for example).

In order to create a new webhook:

1. Navigate to `Your Project / Settings / Webhooks`
1. Create a new webhook with a memorable name.
1. For the URL, use the webhook that your build system provided you with.

## Step 2: Run production build and deployment

1. Run the following command:

   ```shell
   npm run build
   # or
   yarn build

   ```

1. To test the statically exported site, run `npx serve out` and check if the site renders on `localhost:5000`.

1. To deploy, run the command required to transfer the contents of the `./out` directory to your hosting service.

# Appendix B: Configuring the preview mode

1. Set the following env var values:
   ```
   # set preview secret which will be appended to the `secret=` query string variable to activate the preview mode:
   UNIFORM_PREVIEW_SECRET=your-secret
   # Enable it to fetch pre-published content:
   UNIFORM_PREVIEW_ENABLED=true
   ```

1. Run build: `npm run build`.
1. Run start: `npm run start`. This will start the next.js server in preview on `localhost:4120`
1. Open the preview url by passing the following query string parameters:
   - `slug` - the value of the slug of your composition
   - `secret` - the value of the `UNIFORM_PREVIEW_SECRET` env var.

   for example:
   `http://localhost:4120/api/preview?slug=/landing&secret=your-secret`


   > This will enable preview mode, allowing you to change composition, save and see hot reloaded composition without refreshes or publishing.

1. Set the preview url under your project in uniform.app (`Settings` -> `Canvas settings`) and save. This will enable the "preview" button inside the composition editor.
   `http://localhost:4120/api/preview?secret=your-secret`

# Troubleshooting

1. You may get the following error during next build/export if `UNIFORM_PREVIEW_ENABLED=true`. Set this value to false and re-run the build/export process.

   ```

   Pages with `fallback` enabled in `getStaticPaths` can not be exported. See more info here: https://nextjs.org/docs/messages/ssg-fallback-true-export

   ```

1. If you are getting 404 when running `npm run dev`, make sure you publish the Optimize manifest from the dashboard / personalization tab at least once.

    ```bash
    $ uniform optimize manifest download --output ./lib/intentManifest.json
    ⚠ Error fetching intent manifest https://uniform.app/api/v1/manifest?projectId=f902c648-0a96-4874-890b-cf5670743f86
    ❗ 404 Not Found, content No published data for provided API key; it may be invalid, or no publish has occurred since creating it.
    ```

 # Personalization
   Uniform presentation Manager directly support using Uniforms Testing and Personalization capabilites as well. You can easily configure a set of simple Intents and Signals for this demo as well.  

   We suggest configuring the following Intents in the /Personalization tab (Read about Intents here - <https://docs.uniform.app/optimize/intro>) each configured with one Query string signal:
   
   - Men
   - Women
   - Men hipster
   - Women Luxury

  For each Intent, configure one signal:

   - Type: Querystring
   - Name: utm
   - Querystring Parametername: utm_campaign
   - Querystring value: `<same as Intentname - e.g. "Men">`
   - Leave other settings as `Default`
   

  Publish your Intents when done to make them available to your build.


# Appendix C: Configuring hot reload for intent changes
Any changes to intents requires an updated manifest be deployed to your app. The npm script `generate:intents` handles this. This script runs when the app starts. This script can also be configured to run when the intents are published using a Uniform Webhook.

> NOTE: Since Uniform sends a request to your app, your app must be accessible via the internet. You can use ngrok to expose your app.

1. Set the following env var value:
   ```
   UNIFORM_WEBHOOK_SECRET=your-secret
   ```
1. In Uniform, add a webhook that calls the `/api/publish` endpoint and passes the webhook secret value:
   ```
   https://yoursite.com/api/publish/?secret=your-secret
   ```
